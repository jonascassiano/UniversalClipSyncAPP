:hourglass: Work in Progress... 

An awesome app that easily syncs your clipboard with any connected device!

## Motivation

The need to use Chatting Apps and e-mails to share media or text through your own devices. 

_What if we could do it by **tapping a single button** ?_ :iphone: :computer:

## What it does

The story begins with the app listening to your Clipboard. Just after you copy a text, you can notice a pleasant popup icon. Once pressed, it will open a page where you can select your target devices.
